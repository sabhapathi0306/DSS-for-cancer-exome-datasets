# DSS-for-cancer-exome-datasets
decision support system for cancer exome datasets, which helps to predict the percentage probability of cancer type for particular features,through which
one can under go personized treatements based on persentage of prediction and early dignosis of cancer also possible

# NOTE : 
The results or prediction are based on previosly trained data NOT Final dignosis result but based on this prediction method helps on can under go early treatments for cancer
